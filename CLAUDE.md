# Purpose:

Automate the process of backing up your configuration files, dotfiles, and system packages to migrate to a new machine

# Project Rules:

Always use type, do not use interface

Make sure that the project properly lints, builds, and that the tests pass after adding a new feature

# Todos:

Keep an eye on the following files:

README.md (general todos at the bottom)
TODO.LINUX.md
TODO.MACOS.md

# Markdown File Creation:

Save markdown files to the /docs folder if you feel that the information will help you with future tasks, but do not needlessly create files for docs for users. We will write the docs once everything is working correctly
